<h1>The Best Movies According to Tedmeister</h1>>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Beauty and the Beast</h3>
<p>My favorite Disney princess of all time. It is a timely classic of two people falling in love disregard of their appearance.</p>

<h3>Inglorious Bastard</h3>
<p>One of the craziest, funny, yet brutal portraying of the World War 2 history. The heroes are very hilarious and funny.</p>

<h3>Star Wars Movies</h3>
<p>I included all the Star Wars movies because I can't choose a single one. All of them are good movies because I am an avid fan of Star Wars.</p>
